            Sychronization

            <p>
            It lacks sychronizing mechanism such as locks and semaphore.

            Event system
            </h3>
            <p>
            We don't know how cocos2d handles events. Does it handle all events at the end of the main loop? Or right at the time stamp where the event occur?

            </p>
            <p>
            As for the problems above, we decided to develop a new game engine suitable for running grid-based game.

            <h3>
            Player
            </h3>
            <p>
            Subclassed from the Player base class, there are four types of players, namely, HumanPlayer, AIPlayer, StupidAIPlayer, ProgrammedPlayer(Debug purpose)
            </p>
            <h3>
            Input
            </h3>
            <p>
            The input module adopts the Observer design pattern. Human Players subscribe from the input module, and once there comes a keydown event, a corresponding callback will be invoked.
            </p>
            <h3>
            Snake
            </h3>
            <p>
            The player doesn't directly control the snake. The snake simply get the latest input from player, at the end of each time stamp, then decides what to do next.

            World
            </h3>
            <p>
            In every loop, world generally update all players, all snakes, and then try to resolve locks. If it fails, those who haven't aquire locks should get eliminated.
            </p>
            <h3>
            Event
            </h3>
            <p>
            Module A emit an event, and module B, C, D act correspondingly according to predefined binding. By so, coupling among A, B, C and D are mitigated.

            The Factory design pattern is very suitable. For every name, just register a suitable image or movieclip.

imageFactory.register("grid-food", "img/grid-food.png")

            Adopts the Iterator design pattern, which help rendering all items in different layers according to their depths.
